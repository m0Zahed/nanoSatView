## Video Asset for Landing Page

Place your hero video file as:
- `/public/assets/hero-video.mp4`

The landing page is configured to use this video as the background for the hero section.

### Video Recommendations:
- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Duration: 10-30 seconds (will loop)
- File size: Keep under 10MB for optimal loading
- Content: Should be relevant to your project/brand

If you don't have a video yet, you can:
1. Download a free stock video from sites like Pexels or Unsplash
2. Use the placeholder video URL until you have your own
3. Replace the video source in `/src/app/components/LandingPage.tsx`
