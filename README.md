# nanoSatView

Nano SAT VIEW is an advanced application designed to visualize satellite orbits around the Earth. Leveraging the power of ThreeJS for 3D rendering, NextJS Generative UI for a dynamic and responsive user interface, and a robust .NET backend, Nano SAT VIEW offers a comprehensive solution for satellite orbit visualization.

Key features include:

ThreeJS Integration: Utilizes ThreeJS to render realistic and interactive 3D representations of satellite orbits.
NextJS Generative UI: Provides a modern, intuitive, and responsive user interface for seamless interaction.
.NET Backend: Fetches and processes Two-Line Element sets (TLEs), computes the propagated orbits, and sends the data to the renderer for visualization.
With Nano SAT VIEW, users can effortlessly explore and analyze satellite trajectories, making it an essential tool for researchers, educators, and space enthusiasts.
